# Android-TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game, in which two players take turns alternatively. 

Above the 3x3 grid, there is a status bar displaying either "O's turn" or "X's turn", indicating which player's move it is. Below the grid, there is a button called "New Game". When pressed, whatever on the board is cleared and a new game starts. 

When a player, say O, wins the game, the row is highlighted to red and the status bar displays "O won!". The new game button is also highlighted to yellow, telling the user to press it to start a new game.
